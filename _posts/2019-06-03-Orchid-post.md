My first orchid was gifted to me by my mom when I was a freshman. She had heard that cadets at the Academy were authorized to have up to one plant each. It was a large harlequin phalaenopsis. It bloomed twice a year. It was actually two plants, I believe a basal keiki that grew to full size. Sadly, it died when I left it with my family in chilly upstate new york while assigned to my sparsely in-port cutter. I've since hunted for a similar plant to replace it. The modern ones don't have the same quality, unfortunately, but hasn't stopped me from buying two.

I did purchase a few orchids while living in California, probably all from Trader Joe's and Harris Teeters, but had to leave them with friends to get underway again. Decided not to get any more, since it was too awful to leave them behind and I had hoped to stay afloat for my career.

Once I moved to New Orleans, and when I'd decided to leave boats behind, I spontaneously bought another. I purchased it from my favorite garden shop, Urban Roots. I liked going there because they not only had a very tasteful selection, but they also had animals roaming freely, making it a pseudo petting zoo. Chickens, turtles, goats and at least one cat. Urban roots also had a fantastic indoor shop. I mostly picked up herbs for cooking, but occasionally I got an air plant, which were super easy to take care of in New Orleans. One day a rhynchostylis coelestis blue caught my eye. The shop owner surprised me by explaining that it was an orchid. I didn't think an orchid could look like that. It had beautiful wysteria-like sprays of light lavendar, the most symmetrical apple-green foliage, and it came in an adorable blue and dotted pot. After its blues dropped, I went back to the shop and picked up a miniature phalaenopsis with tiny orange flowers. Not a lot of flowers, just two or three, but it made a great foil for the blue of the rhyncho and the shop owner insisted that the blooms were exceptionally long lasting.

Sadly I lost the rhyncho, but in trying to save it, it brought me to the orchid community and I learned huge amounts about caring for these plants. It rebloomed consistently for me every year, stayed small, and kept its amazing symmetry.

The NOID orange phal has rebloomed less reliably, but is blooming for me currently. It's taken on more of a detailed pink than the monochromatic orange of my memory. Probably just environmentals.
