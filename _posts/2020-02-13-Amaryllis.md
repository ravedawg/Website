<h3>Keukenhof</h3>
My sister and I picked up 4 Amaryllis bulbs at Keukenhof while traveling Europe; one for each of us, plus one for our Grandmother and mom. Keukenhof is amazing. We have nothing like it stateside. It's a seasonal park (Spring, Mar-May), on the estate gardens of the Keukenhof Castle, built 1641. Floricultural is culturally and economically important in the Netherlands, and over 100 Dutch companies use the park to showcase their catalogs to the public (tickets were roughly 11 Euro when we went, now in 2021 they run about 18.50). The result is 7 million artistically arranged bulbs blooming almost simultaneously across a 79 acre, thoughtfully laid-out park. I couldn't leave without taking some bulbs home with me to share with my family!

<h3>Long story short</h3>
My mom's and grandmother's bulbs died after one season, and I ended up taking care of my sister's while she was out at sea. Both rebloomed for me while living in California. Temps were cool and they lived next to a large, West-facing window. Then I moved back East and they didn't get sufficient light or a proper winter's rest for 2 years. They atrophied. After moving to a brighter apartment and my favorite started to decline instead of getting better, I got invested in trying to take care of them properly. By this point, they hadn't bloomed in 3 years and started exhibiting reddish blemishes on the leaves and bulb. I learned this to be 'red blotch', a fungal infection that is common with amaryllis.

<h3>Treating Red Blotch</h3>
Didn't go so hot. I dug up both bulbs, and found that my favorite (Apple Blossom) had a very deep rot. I tried to cut it out and treated it with hydrogen peroxide and fungicide, but no luck. The red, however, while not thriving seemed to only have superficial damages. I took off the damaged layer, cut the infected leaves, and alternated warm hydrogen peroxide soaks with fungicide dousing, twice each, allowing to dry fully in-between. Once fully dried after the final treatment, I placed it in two layers of paper bags and left it in the outdoor storage locker for it's first winter dormancy under my watch.

<h3>Potting and Care</h3>
I did sanitize the original pots, soaking in hot water and rubbing alcohol. However I learned that both a sandier blend of potting mix and a smaller pot is preferred by amaryllis; they like a tight fit. In case the red blotch came back, I wanted a fully-glazed pot; the pot I had before was glazed just on the outside for aesthetics. Fortunately my mom had gifted me a really cool vintage McCoy pot. A green pot seemed silly to me at first, I'd prefer something complementary vice competing to the color of foliage, but it's grown on me and I think it works well for an amaryllis which will be set out in the Christmas season and initially leafless.
