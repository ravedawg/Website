<h3>Lobster Etouffee</h3>
This is the first meal Ben and I cooked together. I <em>may</em> have wanted to show off and practice some of the cooking techniques I had learned while living in New Orleans, but I was also missing the great flavors and complex dishes that I'd grown to love. We remade this yesterday for Valentine's Day, just a little over three years since that first time cooking together. Hadn't made it since!

This recipe is based on Emeril Lagasse's crawfish etouffee. I  recall being distressed when I couldn't find crawish locally in Virginia, not even frozen, but honestly lobster is so much easier to work with, and it's fresh and plentiful around Valentine's Day. I made my own stock with lobster and shrimp shells, as well as all the ends and excess from the mire poix. Besides the crawfish and fish stock substitutions, I made the following modifications: no worcestershire, no hot pepper sauce, added some Paul Prudhomme's seafood seasoning, a habenero, some chili pepper flakes, and more than a dash or two of paprika. I think Emeril would approve of the additions. I also learned in New Orleans through lessons and experience to treat garlic gently. So I held it back until I added the stock. Here's the full, modified recipe:

<h3>Recipe</h3>

<ul class="a">
  <li>2 lobster tails</li>
  <li>4 big fresh shrimp (optional)</li>
  <li>2 bay leaves</li>
  <li>2 c diced onion, plus extra for broth</li>
  <li>.5 c diced celery, plus extra for broth</li>
  <li>.5 c diced bell pepper</li>
  <li>4 + 2 Tb butter </li>
  <li>4 Tb flour (30 grams)</li>
  <li>1 tsp Thyme</li>
  <li>.5 tsp Paprika</li>
  <li>Pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 habenero</li>
  <li>1 c diced tomatoes</li>
  <li>1.5 lemon, for its juice plus serving slices</li>
  <li>1 c chopped green onions, some reserved for topping</li>
  <li>.5 c roughly chopped parsley, some reserved for topping</li>

  <li>1.5 c dry rice, cooked for serving ( I like to add green onion to it )</li>
</ul>
1. Stock. Shell the lobster and shrimp. Place shells and bay leaves in filtered water in a sauce pan. Cover and set heat to high. Chop lobster tail into large but bite-size and even pieces (about 8 pieces per tail). Start the rice cooker, if using.
2. Mire poix. Chop and combine onion, celery, bell pepper. Add extra bits and ends to broth.
3. Roux. Melt 4 Tb butter in dutch oven. Once melted, add 4 Tb flour. Make a peanut-butter colored roux by scraping constantly with a roux spoon over med heat. If it burns, start again.
4. Add veggies and spices. Add Mire poix to roux, stir to combine, then add thyme, paprika, Paul Prudhommes, paprika, and pepper to taste. Also habenero. Be conservative with salt, since the etouffe will become more concentrated as it reduces. Stir occassionally for 6-8 m.
5. Add liquids. Once the veggies have softened, add 2.5 c broth and tomatoes. Stir to combine. Cook uncovered for 30m, avoid letting it stick to the bottom. While it cooks, and in-between stirring, prep the green onions, lemon juice and parsley. Stow excess broth for soups another day.
7. Add the green onions, parsley and lemon juice, stir to combine, then add the lobster tail, shrimp and butter. Cook partially covered until the lobster is just cooked through. Serve over white rice with green onion, parsley and lemon slices.
