Makes one boule. Basically I find the 1:4 wheat:AP ratio ideal, but like the roughage of the flax seed. I organized the steps by times, and the possible deviation grows larger as you get to the final steps. That's just the way bread making goes: humidity, temperature, health of the yeast and witchcraft can all impact the time it takes for the bread to rise, and you really want to ensure the bread is in an optimal state when advancing to the next step. Sometimes that means earlier, sometimes that means later. All said, this is a very forgiving, great first recipe that yields awesome artisanal bread. I seems like a lot of steps, but they are all simple and enjoyable, and not at all rushed. It's the perfect excuse to stay home and read books.

<h3>Recipe</h3>
Makes one boule. Adapted from Ken Forkish's FWSY.

<ul class="a">
  <li>400g AP flour</li>
  <li>100g Wheat flour</li>
  <li>1/2 Tbsp ground flax</li>
  <li>360g water, 90-95&degF</li>
  <li>10.5g (1.85 tsp) salt</li>
  <li>2g (1/2 tsp) instant active dry yeast - we use Red Star</li>
</ul>

Prep: Make ready a large bowl for mixing, and prep a lightly oiled bowl for resting and rising. I do this by tearing off a little corner of kitchen towel, adding a drop of oil, and rubbing it around the inside of a bowl. Pre-measure and have ready the salt and dry yeast (your hands will be sticky).

[H:MM]
0:00 - 0:30 Autolyse. Combine flour and water. Mix by hand until just incorporated. Cover and rest 20-30min.

0:30 - 0:35 Mix. Sprinkle salt and yeast evenly on top. Wet hand, fold x4, pinch in half x6, fold x4. Repeat until blended and has tension. Rest 30sec and fold x4. Cover with plastic or a clean plate and let rise.

0:45 First fold: fold x4

~1:45 Second fold *Be sure to leave it alone for the last half hour of rise, perform the second fold when it starts to spread out and lose its structure. Prep a proofing basket: I normally just use a colander lined with a very-clean, large linen napkin and dust lightly with flour.

~5:30 Divide/Shape when dough is triple its volume. If doubling the recipe, divide now. Fold 4x, shape, and place seam-side down to proof. Lightly flour top(s) and cover.

~6:00 - Preheat dutch oven (with lid on) inside oven to 475&degF. If you have two loaves, place on in fridge to space cook times.

~6:25 Check loaves for optimal proofing. You can do this by poking it a good 1/4". If it holds its shape like nothing happened, it needs more time. If the hole you poked remains, it's overproofed and may flatten in the oven. Ideally, it springs back, but slowly.

6:25-7:00 When optimally proofed, bake covered for 30, and uncovered for another 20 or until medium-dark brown. Don't be afraid of a little black-tipping. That's flavor. Be SUPER careful when you remove the lid. I take it fully out of the oven, and very quickly remove the lid once, before the giant steam cloud can burn the hell out of my forearm, which every sourdough baker does once and only once in their journey. You won't forget that burn. Avoid it if you can.

7:15 - 7:50 When done, cool on rack for 30. Preferably until room temp.

7:45 - 8:20 Ready to slice and eat.
