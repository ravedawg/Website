<h3>Rhubarb Quick Bread (or muffins!)</h3>
I love rhubarb. My mom, a Master Gardener, grew it when we lived in Alaska. Every time we moved, we took it with us. It sits happily in the shade by the compost, where it eats coffee grounds, banana peels and eggshells year round and rewards us with delicious red stalks every year, right about when it goes from Spring to Summer. 

When I visit my mom, she'll send me home with a bunch of frozen chunks or stalks and I'll stress about how to optimize it. I've got nothing on my mom's rhubarb pies, so how could I possibly do justice to this foodie gold? I tried rhubarb caramel ice cream, but couldn't get the base right. I also tried cocktail syrup, which wasn't a worthy vehicle. Then last year I saw it being sold in stores for the first time (Whole Foods). So even though it was super over-priced, I splurged and made this quick bread. Then I made it again, and again, perfecting the flavors and finally adapting it to muffins, which are so much easier to share.

The final version uses Samantha Seneviratne's recipe as a template. While I'm sure she's a much better cook than I, I found her original recipe a bit underwhelming, so most of my modifications add flavor and character. Hope you like it!

<h3>Recipe</h3>

<ul class="a">
  <li>1.75c / 227g rhubarb, chopped into 1/3 inch pieces</li>
  <li>1.75c / 223g AP flour</li>
  <li>1/2 Tb dried grated orange zest</li>
  <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp ground cardamom</li>
  <li>8 Tb / 113g unsalted butter, room-temp</li>
  <li>1c / 200g sugar blend: 2 Tb dark brown sugar, 1/3 c light brown sugar, the rest standard white sugar</li>
  <li>1/3 c full fat yogurt</li>
  <li>2 eggs, room temp</li>
  <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 Tb Swedish Pearl sugar (Demerara is also a good sub)</li>
</ul>
1. Prep dry ingredients. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cardamom and dried orange zest. Whisk lightly to mix. Preheat oven to 350 for a loaf, or 400 for muffins.
2. Blend butter and sugar. Use the wrapper of the butter stick to grease the pan.
3. Add eggs, yogurt and vanilla extract to butter blend.
4. Fold in the dry ingredients and mix until it just becomes cohesive. 
5. Use a tiny amount of the mix to make a light layer at the bottom of the pan. Then fold in the rhubarb to the mix and distribute.
6. Decorate with Swedish Pearl sugar and bake for 60-70min for a loaf, or 25-30min for muffins.

They don't look all that impressive, but work colleagues loved them.
