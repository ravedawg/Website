Because orchids lead to fungus gnats, which lead to CPs. Which have quite a lot to love about them in their own right.

<h3>Sundews (Drosera)</h3>
They're just so incredibly effective. Gnat and mosquito killing machines. Also crazy fun to look at. Huge geographic diversity, I believe the most for any CP. Some are temperate and require a winter rest (like Venus Fly Traps), some are tropical.

  There is also an orchid tuber buried in there as a last ditch effort to save it. Chances not good.

<h3>Pinguiculas (Butterwort)</h3>
Butterwort is an awful name for such a cute plant. Not only do they look like adorable, glittery succulents year round, but they also grow the cutest violet-like flowers. "Pings" is so much better.

  Pinguicula I purchased off reddit 12Jul20. Seller said he thought it might be moranensis x ehlersiae. (Pic: August, 2021)
  There were 3 of them, but sadly two died before I figured out that they were being eaten by super tiny nematodes. #3 is doing great though.

  Pinguicula moranensis var. alba "Molongo" x cyclosecta.
  Purchased from California Carnivores. Got it for the purple-tinge. This is a Mexican temperate ping that has a wintertime succulent / non-carnivorous state. All it really means is that I water less when there a fewer bugs flying around. 
  Works for me.

  Pinguicula rotundiflora 'Aramberri, Nuevo Leon'
  Purchased from Curious Plants. It was just too cute: frilly pink leaves, and the flower looks almost like a pale pink nasturtium with a berry center. It's quite small now, hoping it gets a bit larger with time. Supposedly mature size is 1.5".

  Pinguicula laueana "Red". I believe I purchased this from California Carnivores, based on the label matching the Molongo's, but might have been from Curious Plants.
