I love reddit for the horitcultural subs. I learn a lot and there's next to no toxicity. One interesting thing I noted over the past year however was the absolute violence that accompanied Hornworm posts. 

Hornworms are big green caterpillars that like to eat a few bites out of every green tomato on your tomato plant. They are big bugs trying to power through metamorphosis; they need to eat a lot. A single one can easily wreck the entire season's yield of a Beefsteak tomato plant. 


Gardeners on reddit's r/gardening sub have some thoughts about hornworms.

The paradox I observed is that the same sub, r/gardening, feels quite differently about what the hornworm transforms into: a Sphinx moth, also known as a Hummingbird moth.


To explore this further, I pulled all the r/gardening posts from the Summer of 2021 mentioning: hornworms, sphinx moths or hummingbird moths. I ingested the text accompanying each, and came up with some of the following analysis.
