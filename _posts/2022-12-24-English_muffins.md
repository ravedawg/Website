Being a big fan of Thomas Keller, I like to page through the Bouchon Bakery cookbook. In that cookbook, there is a recipe for a childhood favorite that I didn't know a home cook could make: english muffins. And thus, a saga to perfect the english muffin is born.

1. First attempt: Bouchon Bakery recipe
Method: Sourdough, wet-dough baked in self-made parchment rings. XX hrs.
Outcome: little bland and misshapen.

An very wet dough and I didn't yet own muffin molds. I attempted to craft them using parchment paper, pencil, rulers and way too much time. Also ineffective.

2. Re-attempt of Bouchon Bakery
Method: Sourdough, wet-dough baked in steel rings. XX hrs.
Outcome: honestly still a little bland and misshapen (muffin tops).

Muffin rings a little wider than recipe specifies (rings are 4", recipe specifies XX").

3. New recipe: King Arthur's Sourdough English Muffins.
Method: cooked on stove-top in a cast iron pan.
Outcome: better than TK's recipe, and very cute. Maybe a bit small (3").
Can I start by saying it's odd that KA makes a good bit of its money on selling baking accessories, including english muffin rings, yet none of its twelve english muffin recipes actually call for the rings? Ironically, they stop selling the english muffin fork, which can be used with any recipe.

4. New recipe: Tartine ("Tartine A Classic Revisited" 2019 publishing)
Method: Cut and cooked stove top.
Outcome: Good, but a step back from the the KA recipe.

5. The original Tartine recipe ("Tartine Bread")
Method: Baguette dough, pure white flour, ample discard, cut and cooked stove top. Takes two days to prep everything, not including the discard.
Outcome: Partner liked it the most, but I thought it just tasted like baguette.

I think I'll revisit KA and TK, and maybe try another one or two of the ones raved about on social media.
