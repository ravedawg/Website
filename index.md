<p align="middle">The Athenaeum is a small, historic art gallery. We made the difficult choice to exclude children from the event so that we could include a few friends in addition to family.<br>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p align="middle">Old Town is one of our favorite places, and it's very beautiful in the Fall.<br>We look forward to hosting you!</p>
