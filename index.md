We're getting married! And we'd love for you to be there!

Please join us at The Athenaeum in Old Town Alexandria on Friday, October 6th. 

Doors will open at 6pm, ceremony to begin at 6:45pm.

The ceremony will be followed by hors d'oeurvres in The Athenaeum's courtyard, to be followed by dinner and dancing.

The Athenaeum is a very small historic art gallery. We made the difficult choice to exclude children from the invitation so that we could include some friends in addition to family. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

Attire is semi-formal. 

Old Town is one of our favorite places, and it's very beautiful in the Fall. We look forward to celebrating with you!

Love,

Ben and Raven
