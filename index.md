The Athenaeum is a very small historic art gallery. We made the difficult choice to exclude children from the invitation so that we could include some friends in addition to family. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

Attire is semi-formal. 

Old Town is one of our favorite places, and it's very beautiful in the Fall. We look forward to celebrating with you!

Love,

Ben and Raven
