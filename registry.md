<br><br><span style="color: gray;">Our first house! Raven made the raised beds. Ben placed the pavers. We've since removed the AC unit, relocated the washer-dryer, hung a rose trellis, built raised beds in the backyard, and replaced the kitchen backsplash. We have lots of projects planned for the Fall and Winter as well.</span>
